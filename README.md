<h2 align="left">About</h2>
<p align="left">Before starting my course in late September, I joined a computer science Discord server with a suggestions channel. I said that it would be cool if we had a custom Discord bot for the server, and after agreeing with the server owner, I started work on the first prototype. After that, I focused on coding new and improved bot versions during my free time while studying at university. In late June 2024, I finished the project, and the bot is now running 24/7 with features and updates being added to it whenever I have time. </p>
